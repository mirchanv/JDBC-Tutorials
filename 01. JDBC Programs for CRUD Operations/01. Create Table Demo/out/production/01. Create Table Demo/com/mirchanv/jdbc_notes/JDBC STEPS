JDBC STEPS:

1. Load & Register Driver (this step is not required from Java 1.8 onwards)
    -> Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");

2. Establish Connection between JDBC application and Database
    -> Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, pwd);
    -> where url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/durgadb"
    -> where user = "root"
    -> where pwd = "rootroot"

3. Create Statement Object
    -> Statement stmt = con.createStatement();

4. Write and execute MySQL query using executeQuery(), executeUpdate() or execute()

5. Close resources in finally block (this is not required when using try-with resource)
