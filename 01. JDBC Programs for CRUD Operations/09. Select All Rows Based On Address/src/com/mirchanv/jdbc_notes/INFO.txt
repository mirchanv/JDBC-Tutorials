TASK:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We want to write up a jdbc application where we can get all the records from emp1
table based on their location.

When the jdbc application send the sql query to the database engine, it will
execute the query and return back an object in the form of ResultSet.

We have to use this ResultSet object in order to get all entries, and for every
entry we also need extract each column data.

Example SQL Query construction should be in the following format:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"select * from tableName where columnName = 'location'"

FOR EXAMPLE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"select * from emp1 where emp_address = 'Chennai'"
